## How to run my program 
my program needs node.js, express.js, mysql, and express-graphql environment

server_mysql.js for connect mysql database "family" 
server.js for GraphQL
family_tree_backup.sql is the buckup for family tree database schema

then the server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/
http://127.0.0.1:3000/query could show the query result
