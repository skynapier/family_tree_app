# Family Tree App

## Preview of web interface (currently unavaliable will be update in next week):
https://skynapier.github.io/family_tree_app_react/

## Task:

* Build a GraphQL Server (https://graphql.org/code/)
* Write some queries
* Write a react front-end to do queries (e.g. a Family Tree app)
* Build a database to store and retrieve information in e.g. mysql
* Connect the GraphQL API to the database
* (Handle the n+1 problem)


## How to run my programï¼š 
* my program needs node.js, express.js, mysql,cors, React.js and express-graphql environment

* util/util.js for connect mysql database "family" 
* server.js for GraphQL + express server
* family_tree_backup.sql is the buckup for family tree database schema

### command: node server.js: 
* then the server running at http://127.0.0.1:4000/graphql
* I currently allow graphiql to get a GUI for debugging, in further i will use /?query={"your query"}} for GET request
